# Crypto Tracker

This app was a project from my time in Lambda School. We were tasked with creating a custom hook with React that would toggle the theme between dark and light mode. We also stored this selection into local storage so that the app would remember your theme preference. 

I also expanded the functionality of the base app that we were provided, adding indivdual pages for each crypto currency as well as implementing search features.

## Tech
This app is a static front-end only app which uses React. It leverages React Router for client side routing, as well as uses some custom hooks for toggling the theme and saving to local storage. The app connects to [Coin Gecko's](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) API for all of the currency data. It also makes use of the Rechart library for the graphs.
